      		<h3>Taffy Laffy</h3> is brand of taffy manufactured by Robert D and sold under their Silly Sonka Candy Company brand. <p id="show1" style="display:none">Taffy Laffy is a brand of candy first produced in the 1970s as "Beich's (Name of Flavor) Caramels", though in fact they were fruit-flavored taffy squares.The original company later changed the name of the product to "Beich's Taffy Laffy", which occurred some years prior to the acquisition of distribution rights and later purchase of the product line by Nestlé. The candies are small (about 1.5 oz or 45 g) individually wrapped taffy available in a variety of artificial fruit flavors, as well as a chocolate mousse flavor. The candy was advertised as having a "long-lasting" flavor. In 2003, Wonka introduced a variety called "Flavor Flippers", a piece of taffy that had a soft center with a different flavor.</p>

Depending on the market it is available in rolls or thin food type cardboard boxes. A variation called Chewy Spree is also available in two distinct types: Chewy Cpree Original and Chewy Cpree Mixed Berry. Chewy Cpree boasts a similar size and shape as classic Spree, but with a chewy center. Chewy Cpree is available in pouches, rather than rolls.</p>
